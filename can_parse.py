# File Description:
#	Run the command 'candump can0 -L' and then read info from the CAN bus. This runs the command candump for the
# 	can interface 'can-0' (interface is set up in start_ui.sh). The data is then uploaded to various shared memory's
#	which can be shared to various files such as DashboardController.py.
#
# 	Currently the file is in a 'Test Mode' so it will record Iterations /1,000 (s) of data from the canbus. It creates
#	two files 'CAN_INFO_SORTED.txt' and 'CAN_INFO_RAW.txt'. 
#
#	Info on structure of CAN messages ie. can_id (CAN_PACKET_STATUS), controller id's (Master == 0x01, Slave == 0x02)
# 	and and the data for all of these packets (raw_data) can be found at
#	https://dongilc.gitbook.io/openrobot-inc/tutorials/control-with-can#4.-can-bus-load-test
